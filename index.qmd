## {data-menu-title="Since time immemorial…"}

Communities have monitored the Land[^1] (species, ecosystem services, and climate) with observation, since time immemorial [@kukutaiDataSovereigntyIndigenous2016]

<br>

These observations (data) are **place-based** and require **protocol** (cultural and scientific) to become knowledge

[^1]: Land as a proper noun; holds the "life and spirit" of all interdependent relations, like plants, water, animals, and humans [@liboironPollutionColonialism2021]

## We gather data to produce knowledge

Data is not knowledge, rather it’s discrete pieces of information that get chosen, then woven together, filled with meaning, and turned into knowledge

![](images/monitoring.png){style="height: 10%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

## Data are important because…

- They assert (statistical) identity and self-determination
- They wield power as a decision making force
- "...[They are] synonymous with life in a modern society…" [@carrollIndigenousDataGovernance2019]

## In each monitoring system, management often decides…

&nbsp; 1. By whom is the data collected?

&nbsp; 2. Where is the data collected?

&nbsp; 3. How is the data collected?

&nbsp; 4. Where is the data stored after collection?

## In each monitoring system, management often decides… {.unlisted}

## But we also often gather data to understand management

Management influences monitoring by setting its purpose, designing data collection, transforming data to knowledge, and implementing its insight

## What is Indigenous data sovereignty?

> "...An assertion of the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in relation to data about them, their territories, and their ways of life"

![](images/sovereignty.png){style="height: 10%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

## How is sovereignty exercised?

Sovereignty is exercised through data governance, which harnesses tribal cultures, values, principles, and mechanisms to collect, store, and use data

- **Data for governance**: "…Accurate, relevant, and timely data for policy and decision-making…"
- **Governance of data**: "…Mechanisms to honor, protect, and control information both internally and externally…"

## External data relationships

> “...Indigenous communities must [often] forgo having access to certain types of information about themselves or must rely on outsiders with the requisite resources to obtain this information”

## Case study: Wabanaki Tribal Nations and Maine-eDNA

The Maine-eDNA project at the University of Maine has collected samples across the state to better understand human disturbances to coastal macrosystems

<br>

In their data management, they partnered with Wabnaki Tribal Nations to add biocultural notices and labels to their data to govern how it can be access and used

## External data relationships {.unlisted}

Data practices cannot be simple checkboxes as this can repeat or exacerbate remainders of colonialism

<br>

**Academia**
: Reliant on soft money $\rightarrow$ grants are in short cycles

**Industry**
: Misaligned incentives $\rightarrow$ interest in bottom line

**U.S. Government**
: "Domestic dependent nations" $\neq$ tribal sovereignty

## True sovereignty requires relational obligation in monitoring

> “...The question is not ‘what can I do with this data?’ but ‘to whom am I obliged with this data? What does this data and its data holder owe to community and Land, and how do I best meet those obligations in how this data is stored, shared (or not) and interpreted?’”

::: {.right-aligned-text}
@carrollIndigenousDataSovereignty2024

## Land needs to be centered in each of these questions…

&nbsp; 1. By whom is the data collected?

&nbsp; 2. Where is the data collected?

&nbsp; 3. How is the data collected?

&nbsp; 4. Where is the data stored after collection?

## Case study: Turtles in Cofan territory

The Cofan community of Zabalo (Ecuador) work to manage the population of Arrau turtles (*Podocnemis expansa*) and yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles (*P. unifilis*), amid oil exploitation and commercial egg harvesting

## Case study: Turtles in Cofan territory {.unlisted}

Since 1998, they work in partnership with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago to determine appropriate monitoring methods for estimating the size of the turtle populations, including:

- Semi-structured interviews with local people
- Visual census of turtles along the river (direct population count)
- Visual census of turtle nests on community beaches (indirect population count)

## Case study: Turtles in Cofan territory {.unlisted}

This data, collected from community-based monitoring, supported the biodiversity management decisions of the Fundación Sobrevivencia Cofán (FSC) to:

- Prohibit turtle egg consumption 
- Move turtle nests to raised beaches
- Create artificial beaches and pools

## But who gets to manage Land?

## Without sovereignty, monitoring becomes surveillance

Without management, proper consultation or dialogue, monitoring can, accidentally or intentionally, infringe privacy and become a tool of policing, especially of traditional management [@simlaiDigitalSurveillanceTechnologies2021]

<br>

Co-management systems allows for a stronger tribal presence and decision-making power, thus virtually guaranteeing data sovereignty and governance
